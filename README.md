# Hosting-System

A Hosting-System

## Todo

- [x] Think about the role system to prevent bs package creation
- [ ] ProxmoxAPI
  - [ ] Move it to another git repo
  - [ ] Upload it to npm
  - [ ] maybe write a whole documentation

## ERM (Database Model)

![This is the basic DB model.](https://images.jodu555.de/66bdc0f86e16ecb9b672d98871fdf33a.png 'This is the db model till now.')

## Architecture Model

![This is the basic Architecture model.](https://images.jodu555.de/69974706ff4d13a6e8825c64b9e8e3d8.png 'This is the Architecture model till now.')

## Ideas

- Make a thing like task Queue where new orders gets placed so the server dont gets flud by too many orders
  maybe with a static iteration time
- Clarify the UUID's with there syntax like KVM-GS# where KVM stands for the type GS for GENerated services and the # is for the generation
- Types of servers:
  - PACKage Server : Pre defined servers
  - GENerated Server : User defined servers

## MVP - Minimum Viable Product

- [ ] Authentication
- [ ] Balance Increase
- [ ] Product Ordering

## Tech Stack

- Front-end: Vue.js + Vuex + Vue-Router + Bootstrap
- Other: MySql + Stripe + Socket.io
- Back-end: Node.js + Express + ProxmoxApi

## Notes

- All the Balance/Money Realted stuff gets stored as cents so \* 100 to get the corresponding â‚¬ Value | It just makes the math so much easier

## API Route Todos

- [ ] All Routes are Prefixed with HOST/api/
- [x] /packages
  - [x] GET : Shows all packages
  - [x] POST : Creates a new package
- [x] /auth/info : Shows account info (Balance, Name, E-Mail)
- [x] /transactions : Shows all taken Transactions
  - [x] /:ID : Shows a particular transaction
- [ ] /products : Shows all Products
  - [ ] /:ID : Shows a particular Product
  - [ ] /service/:ID : Shows a particular Service (Backend decides from ID if GEN or PACK)
